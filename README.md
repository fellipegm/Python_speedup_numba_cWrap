# Comparison of Python speed-up with Cython C function wrap and numba 

## Valve model simulation results:

Results of simulation of a valve model with Karnopp friction model (dt = integration time step):

Numba is exceptionally good at optimizing the code I had, since I had to do very minor modifications in my code to make it work properly and the results are pretty decent compared to wrapping the C function in Python.

### Pure C
* dt = 5e-6\
exec time: 5.12 s

* dt = 1e-5\
exec time: 2.57 s


### Python pure
* dt = 1e-5\
Simulation time: 886.78 s


### Numba
* dt = 5e-6\
Simulation time: 6.31 s

* dt = 1e-5\
Simulation time: 3.45s


### C Cython wrap
* dt = 5e-6\
Simulation time: 6.07 s

* dt = 1e-5\
Simulation time: 3.29 s


### MATLAB C mex (autogenerated)
* dt = 1e-5\
Karnopp model = 27.5 s
